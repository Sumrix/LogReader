# Log Reader

Log Reader is a powerful desktop application tailored for developers and system administrators grappling with complex, multiline log files. It transforms the tedious task of sifting through extensive logs into a streamlined and manageable process. Leveraging the cross-platform capabilities of AvaloniaUI, Log Reader offers a seamless and responsive experience on Windows, Linux, and macOS, ensuring you can focus on the content that matters, no matter where you are working from.

## 🌟 Features

- **Tabbed Interface**: Work with multiple log files simultaneously through a tabbed document interface.
- **Split View & Multiline Log Analysis**: Our split view interface is specifically engineered for complex, multiline log files. It features a concise list of log entries on the left to facilitate quick browsing, alongside an expanded detail view on the right that clearly delineates each log entry for thorough analysis. This dual-pane approach simplifies the examination of extensive logs, where identifying the start and end of each entry in a standard text editor can be cumbersome.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Stay on top of live updates with automatic refreshes that capture and display log changes as they happen.
- **Performance Optimized**: Built to handle large files with minimal resource consumption, allowing for rapid loading and smooth scrolling, even with substantial log data.
- **Hardcoded Parsing Format**: Comes with a predefined log parsing format, primed for future enhancements and customization.

## 🚀 Planned Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Improve readability with color coding based on log severity or content.
- **Customizable Parsing**: Regex support for user-defined log parsing rules.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Tools to sift through logs based on criteria such as timestamps, severity, or custom patterns.
- **Extensibility**: Ability for users to contribute custom parsers and highlighters to match specific log formats.
